   I'm a passionate embedded systems developer.I've always had an affinity for tinkering with hardware, 
   and combining this with the software elements of programming to create something new has been a brilliant experience.
   I predominantly use Linux as my main operating system and love exploring its capabilities by utilising languages like
   C, Python and shells.
   </p>
   
   <p>
   I also have strong interests in electronics and robotics/IoT,which enables me to push the boundaries of embedded systems
   development even further.Working on projects that boast a complex mix of both software and hardware is where I excel most.
   All of my current efforts are geared towards becoming an even better embedded systems developer in order to continue 
   creating powerful products for tomorrow's society.
